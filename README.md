This repository contains the source code utilized in the videos published in [**Gamma Mathematics**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUhtTAuCuMoL0W7E2loIy_A). I write this code using [**Manim Community Edition**](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), that is based in Grant Sanderson (AKA 3b1b) Manim version, which can be found here, [**Manim 3b1b**](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

## About the Channel

I created this channel with the goal to share a little of my limited knowledge in **Math**, **Physics**, **Chemistry**, **etc**. Showing the beauty of science, proving that it is not as hard as it is thought.
